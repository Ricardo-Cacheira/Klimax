Concept of the game

The game is a 3D snake game under water with xyz movement, where we are going to use boids as fish that are food that makes the snake grow. For the environment we are going to use the game of life logic to create the texture of water/sky and the snakes body will be done using inverse kinematics.

Task distribution

Pedro Santos – inverse kinematics implementation, original movement and camera, audio and additional models.

Raul – game of life textures, original kinematics.

Ricardo – implemented movement and boids as fish food.

Carlos – GUI.

Thales – group manager, assigned tasks/organized group

Jesus Mendola – logo and report document

There was some overlap between all tasks as group members implemented each other&#39;s work and fixed or added minor things to the existing project.

Schedule

Class 1 – General Design discussion, trying to figure out what to do and how to do it.

Class 2 - Start asset development and finalized game idea/concept.

Class 3 – Went over what was done so far, finalized who would do what, worked on stuff relating to presentation that day.

Throughout the last week group members met up online and in campus frequently to work on the project.

Challenges

Once we started working, we had no specific problems with the assignment itself, the challenge was due to the number of members. The team was bigger that what we are accustomed to working with so separating things neatly and making sure everyone had something to do.

In the beginning getting the group all together was hard due to some members missing classes, leading to days where only half of the members would be in class together at a time. Balancing this assignment with the other deliveries was also a bit of a challenge due to the amount of work that ne eded to be done and how it was differently prioritized by the different members of the team.

Overall however, the project went well and the group worked without too many issues together.

On the technical side we ran into small issues with the game of life due to getting too ambitious and trying to implement it as a texture. Otherwise most of the old code we had served us well, including non-class work that some members had from previous game jams that we gutted and used for movement in the project.
